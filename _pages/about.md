I am a diligent and purpose-driven researcher currently working towards earning a PhD in Neuroscience. With a robust background in modeling and computation, my academic journey has led me to disentangle the numerous processes that constitute cellular computation, both at the cellular and the network scale. By using highly detailed multi-scale simulations and advanced, yet explainable machine learning tools, I aim to shed light on how the orchestration of many individual processes, from synaptic input patterns to biophysical dynamics, give rise to high-level information processing in the brain.

Previously, I acquired a Master's degree in Physics and Astronomy, providing me a deep-rooted understanding of the natural sciences and fostering strong analytical and problem-solving skills. This part of my academic journey honed my ability to observe intricate details and tackle problems systematically and effectively. It's this robust scientific foundation which now supports my computational research, empowering me to deal with the complexities encountered within neuroscience.

Parallel to my academic research in neuroscience, I have a keen interest in cutting-edge artificial intelligence solutions, particularly in the realm of explainable AI. My aim is to leverage this technology and integrate it with my field of study, to foster more transparent, understandable, and ultimately, more reliable machine learning models. My use of AI does not just stop at implementation; I am fascinated by the intricacies of its operation and committed to furthering its development for more widespread adaptability in scientific research. My ultimate ambition is to enhance the symbiosis between artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience, thereby propelling advancements that could revolutionize our understanding of the brain.

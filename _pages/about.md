I am a motivated and persistent researcher currently working towards earning a PhD in Neuroscience. With a robust background in modeling and computation, my academic journey has now led me to investigate the rich biological processes underlying cellular computation in the brain. By using highly detailed multi-scale simulations and advanced, yet explainable machine learning tools, I aim to shed light on how the many individual processes, from synaptic input patterns to biophysical dynamics, work together to give rise to high-level information processing in the brain.

Parallel to my academic research in neuroscience, I have a keen interest in explainable AI. My aim is to develop such XAI solutions for neuroscience problems, thereby propelling advancements in both fields that could advance our understanding of how the brain operates.

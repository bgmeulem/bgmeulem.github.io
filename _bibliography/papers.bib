  abstract = {Continuous developments in data science have brought forth an exponential increase in complexity of machine learning models. Additionally, data scientists have become ubiquitous in the private market and academic environments. All of these trends are on a steady rise, and are associated with an increase in power consumption and associated carbon footprint. The increasing carbon footprint of large-scale advanced data science has already received attention, but the latter trend has not. This work aims to estimate the contribution of the increasingly popular “common” data science to the global carbon footprint. To this end, the power consumption of several typical tasks in the aforementioned common data science tasks are measured and compared to: large-scale “advanced” data science, common computer-related tasks, and everyday non-computer related tasks. An automated data science project is also run on various hardware architectures. To assess its sustainability in terms of carbon emission, the measurements are converted to gCO2eq and an equivalent unit of “km driven by car”. Our main findings are: “common” data science consumes 2.57 more power than regular computer usage, but less than some common everyday power-consuming tasks such as lighting or heating; advanced data science consumes substantially more power than common data science, and can be either on par or vastly surpass common everyday power-consuming tasks, depending on the scale of the project. In addition to the reporting of these results, this work also aims to inspire researchers to include power usage and estimated carbon emission as a secondary result in their work.},

  abstract = {Despite the success of complex machine learning algorithms, mostly justified by an outstanding performance in prediction tasks, their inherent opaque nature still represents a challenge to their responsible application. Counterfactual explanations surged as one potential solution to explain individual decision results. However, two major drawbacks directly impact their usability: (1) the isonomic view of feature changes, in which it is not possible to observe \textit{how much} each modified feature influences the prediction, and (2) the lack of graphical resources to visualize the counterfactual explanation. We introduce Counterfactual Feature (change) Importance (CFI) values as a solution: a way of assigning an importance value to each feature change in a given counterfactual explanation. To calculate these values, we propose two potential CFI methods. One is simple, fast, and has a greedy nature. The other, coined CounterShapley, provides a way to calculate Shapley values between the factual-counterfactual pair. Using these importance values, we additionally introduce three chart types to visualize the counterfactual explanations: (a) the Greedy chart, which shows a greedy sequential path for prediction score increase up to predicted class change, (b) the CounterShapley chart, depicting its respective score in a simple and one-dimensional chart, and finally (c) the Constellation chart, which shows all possible combinations of feature changes, and their impact on the model's prediction score. For each of our proposed CFI methods and visualization schemes, we show how they can provide more information on counterfactual explanations. Finally, an open-source implementation is offered, compatible with any counterfactual explanation generator algorithm.},

  abstract={Visualization grammars are gaining popularity as they allow visualization specialists and experienced users to quickly create static and interactive views. Existing grammars, however, mostly focus on abstract views, ignoring three-dimensional (3D) views, which are very important in fields such as natural sciences. We propose a generalized interaction grammar for the problem of coordinating heterogeneous view types, such as standard charts (e.g., based on Vega-Lite) and 3D anatomical views. An important aspect of our web-based framework is that user interactions with data items at various levels of detail can be systematically integrated and used to control the overall layout of the application workspace. With the help of a concise JSON-based specification of the intended workflow, we can handle complex interactive visual analysis scenarios. This enables rapid prototyping and iterative refinement of the visual analysis tool in collaboration with domain experts. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework in two real-world case studies from the field of neuroscience. Since the logic of the presented grammar-based approach for handling interactions between heterogeneous web-based views is free of any application specifics, it can also serve as a template for applications beyond biological research.},
